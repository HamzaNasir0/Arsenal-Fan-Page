Arsenal FC Fan Page
This project is a simple, single-page website dedicated to Arsenal Football Club. It's built using only HTML and CSS to showcase the club's history, major honors, and a few interactive forms for fans. The site is fully responsive and a great example of a basic static website.

Features 
Club Honours: A table listing Arsenal's major trophies, including League titles and FA Cups.

Top Goalscorers: A table of the club's all-time top 5 goalscorers, with links to their player profiles.

Player Selection Forms: Interactive forms that allow users to select their favorite players for a 4-3-3 formation and submit their player ratings and feedback.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be easily viewable on both desktop and mobile devices.
